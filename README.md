## What's This?

Reading translations is like watching a movie described over the phone‚Äîyou get the plot, but miss the soul.

**PRAVIEL** teaches you to read Homer, Plato, and the *Bhagavad-Gƒ´tƒÅ* as they were written. From Sumerian cuneiform (3100 BCE) to medieval manuscripts (1200 CE), we're making 46 ancient languages accessible through modern AI while maintaining research-grade accuracy.

This repo is the **marketing website**. For the main platform (Python/FastAPI + Flutter), see [antonsoo/praviel](https://github.com/antonsoo/praviel).

## What's Inside

- üé® **Three.js hero scene** with shader animations
- ‚ö° **Buttery smooth scrolling** (Lenis)
- üé≠ **Motion animations** that don't suck
- üì± **Actually responsive** (we tested on real devices)
- üåç **Edge-deployed** on Cloudflare Workers

---

## Tech Stack

Built with cutting-edge 2025 tech (yes, this stuff exists now):

**Frontend:** Next.js 16 ‚Ä¢ React 19.2 ‚Ä¢ TypeScript 5.9 ‚Ä¢ Tailwind v4
**Animation:** Motion (Framer successor) ‚Ä¢ Three.js ‚Ä¢ React Three Fiber
**Deploy:** Cloudflare Workers ‚Ä¢ OpenNext ‚Ä¢ Node.js 25+
**Tooling:** Turbopack ‚Ä¢ React Compiler ‚Ä¢ ESLint 9 flat config

> **Note:** This isn't "let's use the latest alpha versions." These are stable releases from late 2025. If your Node version is lower than 25, you need to upgrade‚Äîit's not a typo.

---

## Quick Start

**Requirements:** Node.js 25+ and pnpm

```bash
# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/antonsoo/praviel-website.git
cd praviel-website
pnpm install

# Start dev server
pnpm dev  # ‚Üí http://localhost:3000
```

**Common commands:**
```bash
pnpm dev         # Standard Next.js dev server
pnpm preview     # Local Cloudflare Workers preview
pnpm build       # Production build
pnpm typecheck   # TypeScript validation
pnpm lint        # ESLint check
```

---

## Deployment

We use **[OpenNext](https://opennext.js.org/)** to deploy Next.js on Cloudflare Workers.

```bash
pnpm preview  # Local Cloudflare Workers preview
pnpm deploy   # Deploy to production
pnpm upload   # Gradual rollout
```

You'll need Cloudflare credentials configured in `wrangler.jsonc`. Secrets go via `pnpm wrangler secret put <KEY_NAME>`.

## Project Structure

```
app/            # Next.js App Router pages
components/     # React components
lib/            # Utilities
public/         # Static assets
docs/           # Documentation
.github/        # GitHub config (funding, etc.)
```

Standard Next.js 16 structure. If you've used Next before, you know where everything is.

---

## Environment Variables

**Public vars** (prefixed `NEXT_PUBLIC_`) are safe to commit. **Secrets** go in `.dev.vars` locally and Cloudflare Wrangler for production (`pnpm wrangler secret put`).

See `wrangler.jsonc` for the full list. Don't commit secrets. Rotate them if you do.

---

## Contributing

Pull requests welcome! Fork, create a feature branch, make sure `pnpm typecheck` and `pnpm lint` pass, then PR.

Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/): `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`

Don't commit secrets. Clean up your console.logs. Read [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for the full developer guide.
