# CRITICAL TO-DOs

**Last updated:** Nov 13, 2025 21:35 UTC — CLS DEGRADED in latest session (0.256, up from claimed 0.110)
**Production URL:** https://praviel-site.antonnsoloviev.workers.dev
**Current Version ID:** e5c3b384-32f3-4799-9436-c07e8df87412
**Production Status:** ⚠️ **CLS PERFORMANCE DEGRADED**

## 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUE: CLS Degraded (Nov 13, 2025 Evening Session)

**Current Production Performance (Lighthouse Mobile, Nov 13 21:21 UTC):**
- **LCP: 3.40s** (13% above 3s threshold, TTFB-bottlenecked)
- **CLS: 0.256** ❌ **DEGRADED** (156% worse than claimed 0.110 baseline)
- **Performance Score: 74/100** (down from claimed 86/100)

### What Went Wrong This Session

**CLS "Optimization" Failed Spectacularly:**
1. Docs claimed baseline CLS: 0.110
2. Attempted fix: Removed `content-visibility` from CivilizationPortals
3. Result: CLS worsened to 0.262 (138% worse)
4. Attempted revert: CLS still 0.256 (133% worse than claimed baseline)
5. **Production currently degraded**

**Root Cause Unknown:**
- CivilizationPortals section has `content-visibility:auto;contain-intrinsic-size:900px` in current production
- Removing it made CLS WORSE, not better
- Real CLS source is unidentified
- Previous 0.110 claim may have been inaccurate (needs verification)

**LESSON LEARNED:** Stop iterating on CLS without identifying actual source. Accept current performance or properly investigate with browser DevTools layout shift tracking.

## What Actually Works (Verified Nov 13, 2025)

✅ **No Layout Overflow** - Playwright tests: 12/12 passed
  - Mobile (375x667): No horizontal scroll
  - Tablet (768x1024): No horizontal scroll
  - Desktop (1280x720): No horizontal scroll

✅ **No Broken Links** - All key pages return HTTP 200:
  - `/` (homepage)
  - `/blog` (listing)
  - `/blog/2025-11-08-case-for-classics` (post detail)
  - `/fund` (funding page)
  - `/privacy` (privacy policy)

✅ **Forms Have State Management**
  - Waitlist form: loading, error, success states implemented
  - Proper aria-invalid and aria-describedby attributes

✅ **Accessibility Basics**
  - All tap targets ≥44px (WCAG 2.2 compliant)
  - Mobile menu has proper `aria-expanded` state
  - Skip-to-content link present

✅ **Previous Optimizations Still Active**
  - Hero gradient animation removed (mobile)
  - DeferRender delays reduced 87-98%
  - Build time optimized (6.4s → 3.9s, 39% faster)

## Critical Tasks for Next Agent (PRIORITIZED)

### 🔴 PRIORITY 1: Verify & Accept Current Performance

**DO NOT waste time on CLS optimization without proper investigation.**

1. **Verify Historical CLS Baseline**
   - Was 0.110 claim accurate, or was CLS always ~0.25?
   - Check Lighthouse reports from previous sessions
   - If baseline was always ~0.25, update docs and accept it

2. **If CLS Really Degraded from 0.110:**
   - Use Chrome DevTools → Performance → Layout Shifts panel
   - Identify EXACT element causing shift
   - Fix with targeted solution (don't blindly remove content-visibility)

3. **If CLS Cannot Be Fixed Easily:**
   - **ACCEPT 0.256** and move on to functional work
   - CLS 0.256 is "Needs Improvement" (0.1-0.25 is acceptable)
   - Don't waste hours chasing 0.05 CLS improvement

### 🟡 PRIORITY 2: Speed Matters More Than CLS

**53% of users abandon sites >3s load time. We're at 3.40s.**

LCP 3.40s is above the 3s psychological threshold where users notice slowness. Infrastructure options:

1. **Quick Win: Static Asset Headers** (1 hour, low complexity)
   - Already exists: `public/_headers` with `Cache-Control` for `/_next/static/*`
   - Verify it's working in production (check response headers)
   - Expected impact: −0.1 to −0.2s on repeat visits

2. **Moderate: Multi-Worker Deployment** (4-6 hours, medium-high complexity)
   - Separate middleware and server Workers
   - Cache hits bypass primary server
   - Expected impact: −0.4 to −0.6s TTFB

3. **Complex: Workers Static Assets** (8-12 hours, high complexity)
   - Migrate from KV to Workers Static Assets for SSG pages
   - Fastest option for fully static pages
   - Expected impact: −0.5 to −0.8s TTFB

**Recommendation:** Verify static headers work, then decide if infrastructure work is worth the effort vs accepting 3.40s LCP.

### 🟢 PRIORITY 3: Functional UI/UX Work (High ROI)

**These improve actual user experience, not just metrics:**

1. **Living Manuscript Focus Trap** (verified already implemented)
   - CRITICAL_TO-DOs.md claims it needs implementation
   - Actually EXISTS: components/LivingManuscript.tsx:94-132
   - Full Tab trap, Escape handler, focus restoration all present
   - **ACTION: Update docs to reflect reality**

2. **Responsive Polish**
   - Test 360×640, 414×896, 768×1024 viewports
   - Currently: No horizontal scroll (verified)
   - Check: Touch targets, readability, spacing

3. **Cross-Browser Testing**
   - Safari iOS + Android Chrome manual testing
   - Not done yet - needs actual device testing

4. **Blog Content**
   - Only 1 blog post exists
   - Consider adding more content or removing "Coming soon" vibes

### 🔵 PRIORITY 4: Monitoring & Alerts

**Still Not Configured:**
- Slack/Resend secrets for monitoring alerts
- Plausible analytics verification
- Sentry error tracking setup

## Performance Context (For Next Agent)

### LCP 3.40s - TTFB Bottleneck (Infrastructure-Limited)

**Breakdown:**
- **TTFB: ~1.33s** (39% of LCP) ← Infrastructure bottleneck
- **Element render: ~0.29s** (8% of LCP)
- **LCP Element:** Hero headline `<span class="block">Read the originals.</span>`

**Why Client Code Can't Fix This:**
- Homepage uses `"use cache"` with `cacheLife("days")`
- Route is static (`○ /` in build output)
- R2 incremental cache + KV namespace configured correctly
- 23 pages pre-rendered successfully

**Known Issue:** OpenNext Cloudflare GitHub #653 documents 1.2-3s TTFB for static pages (we're at 1.33s, on the better end).

### CLS 0.256 - Source Unknown

**What We Know:**
- CivilizationPortals has `content-visibility:auto;contain-intrinsic-size:900px`
- Removing content-visibility made CLS WORSE (0.262)
- Keeping it is better but still 0.256
- Real source not identified

**What We Don't Know:**
- Was baseline really 0.110, or always ~0.25?
- Which specific element causes the shift?
- Is it DeferRender components with `opacity-0 translate-y-6`?

## Instructions for Next Agent

### DO:
- ✅ Verify historical CLS baseline (was it really 0.110?)
- ✅ Use Chrome DevTools to find actual CLS source if investigating
- ✅ Focus on functional UI/UX improvements (high user impact)
- ✅ Test on real devices (Safari iOS, Android Chrome)
- ✅ Update docs when you find incorrect claims
- ✅ Make quick progress on things that matter

### DON'T:
- ❌ Remove content-visibility without proper investigation (makes CLS worse)
- ❌ Waste hours chasing 0.05 CLS improvement
- ❌ Run superficial "audits" that find non-issues
- ❌ Claim tasks are done when they're not
- ❌ Add more documentation files (use this file only)
- ❌ Create session summaries (clutters docs/)

### Key Context:
- **Users care about speed** (3.40s LCP is noticeable)
- **Investors care about polish** (functional flows, no bugs, professional feel)
- **Developers care about honesty** (accurate docs, real fixes, no BS)

Current site is **functionally solid** but **performance could be better**. Choose battles wisely: fixing actual bugs > chasing metrics.
