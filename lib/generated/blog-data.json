Native <a href=\"https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/view-transitions\">View Transitions</a> finally stabilized in Next.js 16, so we leaned on them for the blog list/detail flow and for the hero CTA states. The goals were simple:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Keep largest-contentful-paint (LCP) under 2.5 s on a throttled Pixel 5.</li>\n<li>Respect <code>prefers-reduced-motion</code>, <code>Save-Data</code>, and our new Immersive Mode toggle.</li>\n<li>Never require a Canvas layer or custom shader just to impress investors.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Layering immersive effects responsibly</h2>\n<p>We now lazy-load a bundle that contains the torch cursor, volumetric fog, film grain, and cursor glow. That bundle only hydrates if <strong>all</strong> of these are true:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The visitor scrolls at least 120 px or interacts with the page.</li>\n<li>Functional cookies are allowed (we store the preference locally and mirror across tabs).</li>\n<li>Hardware isn’t flagged as low-power (<code>hardwareConcurrency &#x3C;= 4</code>, <code>prefers-reduced-motion</code>, or <code>Save-Data</code>).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If any check fails, we stop at static gradients. The new Immersive Mode toggle simply overrides those heuristics, and the setting is synced via <code>localStorage</code> so your choice persists across visits.</p>\n<h2>View Transitions on the blog</h2>\n<p>The blog list now wraps each card in a <code>viewTransitionName</code>. When you click a Field Report, the title, date stamp, and card shell morph into their detail counterparts. Because the content is prerendered via <code>cacheComponents</code>, the state swap stays instant even on edge deployments. We also added a Playwright regression (<code>tests/e2e/blog-navigation.spec.ts</code>) that ensures <code>/blog</code> never flashes a 404 while transitions are in flight.</p>\n<h2>LCP guardrails we put in place</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The hero’s heading is visible on mobile again, which keeps the candidate lightweight text rather than a decorative poster.</li>\n<li>Mobile hero CTAs sit below the copy, trim 20% of their height, and ship with <code>data-lcp-target</code> markers so our <code>pnpm lcp:debug</code> script can surface them quickly.</li>\n<li>Background columns, constellations, and ticker animations all disable automatically on small viewports or when Immersive Mode is set to “Minimal.”</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Early throttled runs show mobile LCP hovering around <strong>2.2 s</strong> with INP at <strong>118 ms</strong>. We still need to re-run the five-pass Lighthouse suite before publishing the numbers, but the hero is no longer the bottleneck.</p>\n<h2>What’s next</h2>\n<p>The next round is all about <strong>consistency</strong>: ensuring Safari’s partial View Transitions support degrades cleanly, validating the tactile cursor on Android 15 Beta, and wiring the nightly workflow so Plausible proxy, blog navigation, and Lighthouse audits happen automatically at 06:30 UTC. If you spot a regression, ping <code>anton@praviel.com</code>—we ship fast, but we ship with receipts.</p>\n",

      "content": "<h2>Introduction: Why Ancient Languages Matter Now</h2>\n<p>For centuries, a classical education centered on Latin and Ancient Greek was the bedrock of Western intellectual life. It was considered the essential training for a well-formed mind, providing not just linguistic skill, but also a direct connection to the foundational ideas of history, philosophy, and art. Yet, over the last century, this tradition has faced a dramatic decline, leaving a void that many educators and thinkers are now beginning to earnestly reconsider.</p>\n<p>This report chronicles the historical prevalence of classical education, investigates the complex reasons for its recession, and documents the modern efforts to revive it. But it also serves a greater purpose: to make the case for a new approach to preserving this vital part of our shared human heritage.</p>\n<p>Every time an ancient text is translated, something is lost—subtle nuances, cultural context, and rhetorical power vanish, leaving us with what one scholar called \"an echo, not the original voice.\" The decline of classical education has severed this direct connection for millions. The purpose of my work with the <strong>Ancient Languages</strong> application is to restore it. By leveraging modern technology, we can make the study of these foundational languages more accessible, engaging, and rigorous than ever before. Understanding the story of the classics—their fall and their nascent revival—illuminates the critical importance of this mission. It shows us not only what was lost, but also how we can build a vibrant future where anyone can engage directly with the greatest minds of the past.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Historical Implementation of Classical Education (Latin &#x26; Greek)</h2>\n<p>Classical education—centered on Latin and Ancient Greek—was once a pillar of elite schooling across Western countries. The table below outlines major countries and periods when Latin and Greek were integral, often compulsory, in education.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th align=\"left\">Country/Region</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Era of Classical Education Dominance</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Latin/Greek Requirements</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>Great Britain</strong> (England &#x26; UK)</td>\n<td align=\"left\">16th – mid-20th c.</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Latin was the core of grammar school curricula from the Renaissance through the early 1900s. Mastery of Latin was required for university entrance (Oxford/Cambridge) until the 1960s. Some Greek was taught at elite \"public\" schools (e.g., Eton); Oxford/Cambridge required an O-level in Latin (and until the early 20th c., Greek) for matriculation. The term \"Latin school\" survived in Britain for academic secondary schools.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>United States</strong></td>\n<td align=\"left\">17th – early 20th c.</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Latin and often Greek dominated colonial and 19th-century curricula. Early colleges taught in Latin, and admission often required Latin/Greek knowledge. Harvard's 1642 exam, for example, required reading classical Latin authors and basic Greek. By 1900, approximately 50% of U.S. public high school students studied Latin as preparation for college. Yale kept Greek entrance requirements until 1904 and Latin until 1931, after which classical languages ceased to be mandatory for college-bound students.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>Germany</strong> (Prussia)</td>\n<td align=\"left\">18th – mid-20th c.</td>\n<td align=\"left\">The humanistic <em>Gymnasium</em> was the direct successor of the medieval Latin school. It required Latin (and in <em>Altsprachliches Gymnasium</em>, Ancient Greek) for university-track students. In the 19th c., alternative schools (<em>Realgymnasium/Realschule</em>) emerged, emphasizing modern languages and science instead. Still, through the early 1900s, the classical <em>Gymnasium</em> was the gateway to universities and the civil service.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>France</strong></td>\n<td align=\"left\">19th – mid-20th c.</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Under Napoleonic reforms, the <em>lycée</em> had a \"classical\" track requiring Latin (and often Greek). Latin was the prestige subject for the <em>baccalauréat</em>. By the mid-20th c., Latin became optional, and by 2023, only ~9% of French secondary students take any Latin.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>Italy</strong></td>\n<td align=\"left\">1860s – present (classical track)</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Since unification, Italy established the <em>Liceo Classico</em>, where Latin and Ancient Greek are compulsory. This track, historically for the intellectual elite, still exists. Today, about one-third of Italian high-school graduates have studied Latin for five years, reflecting an enduring classical curriculum.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><strong>Other Europe</strong> (Spain, Austria, etc.)</td>\n<td align=\"left\">16th – 20th c.</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Latin \"trivial\" schools were common across Europe by 1500. In the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Spain, the Netherlands, and Scandinavia, Latin was long taught in preparatory schools. Generally, Latin was phased out as a universal requirement in the late 19th or mid-20th century as national systems moved to broaden access and emphasize sciences.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> In the medieval and early-modern period, Latin was the <em>lingua franca</em> of education across Europe. Universities conducted lectures in Latin, and secondary \"Latin schools\" prepared students for that world. Ancient Greek entered curricula during the Renaissance (15th–16th c.) as Humanist scholars advocated for reading original texts. Thus, by the 18th and 19th centuries, a “classical education” was the hallmark of an educated person in the West.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Shift and Decline: When and Why Classical Education Receded</h2>\n<p>By the 20th century, most countries dropped Latin and Greek as core requirements due to changing educational priorities and democratization.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Early 20th Century Reforms:</strong> In the U.S., major universities began eliminating classical language entrance exams. Harvard made Greek optional in the 1880s-1890s, and Yale retained mandatory Greek until 1904 and Latin until 1931. As top colleges dropped requirements, high schools followed suit. This pattern repeated elsewhere; Cambridge and Oxford abolished their Latin entrance exam by 1960-61.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Widening Access and \"Utilitarian\" Education:</strong> As secondary education expanded to the masses, classical languages were increasingly seen as elitist or impractical. Educators pushed for curricula that prepared students for modern careers. Figures like Benjamin Franklin and Benjamin Rush argued for replacing Greek/Latin with science, engineering, and modern languages. This trend, amplified by Progressive education (John Dewey), prioritized \"real-world\" skills over classical rote learning.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Mid-20th Century (Post-War) Drop-Off:</strong> The most dramatic decline occurred between the 1950s and 1970s. After WWII, and especially after the Soviet Sputnik launch (1957), U.S. education policy emphasized science and technology. Foreign language requirements shifted toward Russian or Spanish. One oft-cited statistic illustrates this collapse: the number of U.S. high-school Latin students plummeted from <strong>~700,000 in 1962 to ~150,000 in 1976</strong>—an 80% drop in just 15 years.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Key Reasons for the Decline:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Democratization and Anti-Elitism:</strong> As secondary education became universal, educators saw the classics as an \"elitist\" vestige inconsistent with egalitarian access. School systems dropped requirements that might disadvantage students without preparatory Latin.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Scientific and Technical Focus:</strong> The economy's needs shifted to science, engineering, and modern skills. In the U.S., federal initiatives like the National Defense Education Act (1958) poured resources into science and modern foreign languages—but not Latin.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Educational Theory – Progressivism:</strong> Progressive educators argued for less rote memorization and more \"learning by doing.\" The old grammar-translation method of Latin was considered pedantic and unsuited for the general student population.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Cultural and Ideological Shifts:</strong> After WWII, Western culture experienced what historians call a \"declining confidence in humanistic ideals.\" Intellectuals questioned the value of the Western canon, and emerging philosophies like moral relativism and postmodernism challenged the idea that Greeks and Romans provided universal models of truth and virtue.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>End of Latin in the Church:</strong> The Catholic Church's Second Vatican Council (1962-65) ended the routine use of Latin in the Mass. Catholic schools, which had been bastions of Latin, rapidly scaled back instruction, removing a major institutional motive for teaching the language.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By the late 20th century, classical education had survived mainly in some elite high schools or as a specialized university major, rather than as a cornerstone of general education. The most rapid collapse happened between <strong>1950 and 1970</strong>. In 1940, a college-bound student in the U.S. or UK might still be expected to have some Latin; by 1970, this was largely unheard of.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Intellectual Trends Contributing to the Decline</h2>\n<p>Several intellectual movements collectively shifted educators' attitudes away from the Greco-Roman classics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Pragmatism and Utilitarianism:</strong> Philosophers like John Dewey argued that curricula should prioritize contemporary knowledge and skills. The classical languages came under fire for lacking direct utility. The question \"What practical use is this?\" was often answered with \"none.\"</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Progressivism in Education:</strong> This student-centered movement viewed the traditional classical curriculum as overly rigid and irrelevant. It introduced electives and \"life adjustment\" courses, often at the expense of Latin and Greek.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Modernism and the Sciences:</strong> The broader cultural movement of modernism valued innovation over tradition. As scientific disciplines advanced, the cultural authority of classical antiquity waned. In 1800, citing Aristotle or Cicero bestowed intellectual legitimacy; by 1950, citing Newton or Darwin did.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Marxism and Critical Pedagogy:</strong> Leftist critiques viewed the \"classical education\" of the elite as a mechanism of class reproduction. Later critical pedagogy theories questioned whose knowledge was being taught, arguing that an emphasis on Greek and Latin authors centered on \"dead white males\" and ignored other histories.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Postmodernism and Relativism:</strong> Postmodern thought challenged the idea of any single cultural tradition being the benchmark of knowledge. The classics went from being seen as timeless wisdom to just one cultural perspective among many. This intellectual climate made it easier for educators to drop classical requirements in favor of diversified curricula.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Multiculturalism and Identity-Based Critiques:</strong> From the 1980s onward, movements for multicultural education argued that curriculums should reflect diverse cultures, not just Europe's \"classical\" heritage. Some academics examined how classics had been used to further colonialist or racist agendas, contributing to reduced enthusiasm for upholding classics as the core of education.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In summary, ideological currents from multiple directions converged to dethrone classical education. Traditionalists lost the argument that Latin and Greek were indispensable, while progressive and pragmatic thinkers saw classical language study as anachronistic.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Consequences of Removing Classical Education</h2>\n<p>What happens when schools stop teaching Latin and Greek? Researchers and educators have debated the impacts for decades. Several negative consequences are commonly noted:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Erosion of Verbal Skills and Vocabulary:</strong> A strong claim among scholars is that abandoning rigorous language study has contributed to a measurable decline in students' verbal abilities. They point to data such as U.S. SAT scores: between the early 1960s and early 1980s—precisely when classical curricula were dropped—<strong>SAT Verbal scores plunged significantly</strong>. Unlike math scores, verbal scores stagnated at low levels and never returned to their previous highs. The implication is that generations no longer drilled in grammar, translation, and classical literature have a weaker command of complex English.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Loss of Critical Thinking Rigor:</strong> Classical language education was long believed to develop mental discipline. Translating a Latin sentence requires holding multiple clauses in mind—a kind of mental juggling that some educators say builds intellectual stamina. With the decline of Latin, some fear that students miss this formative exercise.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Cultural and Historical Illiteracy:</strong> A commonly voiced consequence is that students without classical education are less aware of the foundations of Western literature, history, and philosophy. Greco-Roman references permeate our world. Without exposure to Latin or Greek authors, students may lack context for concepts like democracy (from Athens) or republicanism (Rome). English idioms are replete with classical allusions (e.g., Achilles' heel, Herculean task, Pandora's box); without some classical literacy, these references lose their meaning.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Reduced Intellectual Autonomy:</strong> Reading ancient texts in the original allows one to engage directly with some of the greatest minds in history without mediation. Without this ability, modern students must rely on translators and commentators, losing important nuances and rhetorical subtleties. As historian Daniel Howe observed, 19th-century Americans drew on classical exemplars for patriotism and virtue; losing that common reference point can weaken civic culture.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Moral and Ethical Implications:</strong> Classical literature and history pose enduring ethical questions. Advocates like Yale's 1828 report claimed the classics \"imbue [the] mind with principles of liberty, inspire patriotism, and excite to noble action.\" The disappearance of classical education has led some to argue that we've lost a certain depth in moral reasoning in education. Thinkers like Cornel West have lamented the closure of classics departments as a \"spiritual catastrophe\" that marks a broader moral and intellectual narrowing.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h2>The State of Classics in Academia: Crisis and Critiques</h2>\n<p>In higher education, the field of classics is widely considered to be in a fragile state. Key indicators include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Declining Enrollments and Programs:</strong> The number of students majoring in Classics has dropped sharply. In the U.S., annual bachelor's degrees in Classics fell from over 1,200 in 2013 to just 736 in 2020—a 40% decline in less than a decade. As enrollments decline, many colleges have eliminated or downsized their Classics departments. In 2021, Howard University closed its classics department, joining at least a dozen other institutions that have done so in recent years.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Curricular Changes and Standards:</strong> One controversial development is a move to make classics more accessible by dropping rigorous language requirements. For instance, Princeton's classics department in 2021 dropped its undergraduate Greek/Latin language requirement to encourage a more inclusive range of students. While this aims to increase diversity, critics see it as a lowering of standards that undermines the core of what \"classics\" means—engagement with original texts.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Ideological Critiques of Classics:</strong> The field has faced intense reflection on its entanglement with Western imperialism and exclusionary narratives. This has led to calls for \"decolonizing\" classics: re-examining how and why we study Greece and Rome. This has created an identity crisis, forcing classicists to articulate new rationales for their discipline in a multicultural, 21st-century context.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Popular Interest vs. Academic Decline:</strong> Interestingly, even as formal academic programs shrink, interest in classical antiquity among the general public remains evident. Bestselling novels (<em>Circe</em>, <em>Song of Achilles</em>), blockbuster movies (<em>Gladiator</em>), and video games (<em>Assassin's Creed Odyssey</em>) show that Greco-Roman myths and history still fascinate people. The challenge for the field is to bridge the gap between this widespread enthusiasm and the declining academic pipeline for rigorous classical training.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h2>Revival Efforts and Modern Movements in Classical Education</h2>\n<p>Despite the decline, the story of classical education is not only one of decay. In recent decades, there have been notable revival efforts and innovative movements to re-incorporate Latin, Greek, and classical learning.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Classical Education Movement in K-12 Schools (Especially U.S.):</strong> A significant revival is happening in primary and secondary education through a loose coalition of private classical schools, charter schools, and homeschooling networks. In the United States, hundreds of new schools have adopted a classical model in the last 20 years. These schools often require Latin starting in the middle grades and have demonstrated that a classical curriculum can be adapted to diverse, modern classrooms, often with excellent academic results.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>UK and Europe School Initiatives:</strong> In the UK, where state schools largely dropped Latin, charities like <strong>Classics for All</strong> have worked to reintroduce the subject. As of the mid-2020s, about 20% of UK secondary schools offer Latin, a notable presence given its near-extinction in state schools a few decades ago. The <strong>Cambridge Latin Course</strong>, which uses a story-driven method, revolutionized Latin teaching and is credited with \"saving Latin\" in many British schools.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Pedagogical Innovation – Living Latin:</strong> A movement known as “Living Latin” or “Active Latin” has emerged, using spoken Latin in the classroom to teach the language more naturally, like a modern language. This approach has made Latin more engaging and is credited with helping its small resurgence.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Digital Resources and Online Communities:</strong> The internet has dramatically increased access to classical literature and learning tools. Projects like the <strong>Perseus Digital Library</strong> put a vast corpus of Greek and Latin texts online with powerful analytical tools. Online communities, forums, and even Duolingo's Latin course have created a neo-classical education space outside of traditional schools. Paradoxically, this means classical education is more accessible today than ever before, even as formal enrollment has dropped.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Results of Revival Efforts:</strong> These initiatives have seen quantifiable successes. Latin enrollment in the U.S., after free-falling in the 1970s, actually <strong>stabilized and modestly rebounded by the 2000s</strong>. The AP Latin exam now has over 6,000 takers a year—small compared to Spanish, but not negligible. Qualitatively, Latin's image has improved from a \"boring dead language\" to a “cool, intellectually demanding elective.”</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h2>The Path Forward: A New Era for Ancient Languages</h2>\n<p>The history is clear: classical education, once the unchallenged core of learning, declined due to profound shifts in social, cultural, and technological priorities. Yet, its value persists. The intellectual rigor, the cultural literacy, and the direct line to foundational human thought it provides are arguably more necessary than ever in our fragmented modern world.</p>\n<p>The revival efforts show a powerful, persistent hunger for this knowledge. The challenge is no longer a lack of interest, but a lack of accessible and engaging pathways to learn. This is where the story of the past meets the promise of the future.</p>\n<p>The <strong>Ancient Languages</strong> project was born from this understanding. Our mission is to harness the power of modern technology to solve this age-old problem of access. By combining an addictive, gamified user experience with research-grade academic rigor, we are creating a platform to learn ancient languages that is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Academically Sound:</strong> Built on authoritative sources like the Perseus Digital Library and the Liddell-Scott-Jones Lexicon, ensuring every lesson is grounded in real scholarship, not AI hallucinations.</li>\n<li><strong>Deeply Engaging:</strong> Moving beyond rote memorization with interactive AI tutors, conversational practice with historical personas, and progress tracking that makes learning feel like an adventure.</li>\n<li><strong>Radically Accessible:</strong> Offering a comprehensive curriculum for free, from the alphabet to reading masterworks like the <em>Iliad</em> in their original form.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The decline of classical education was a great loss, but it does not have to be the end of the story. The current revival, powered by dedicated teachers and passionate learners, proves that the desire to connect with our past is timeless. Our goal is to provide the tools to fuel that revival, ensuring that the great conversations of history are open to everyone, for generations to come. We are not just preserving dead languages; we are revitalizing the living wisdom they contain.</p>\n",
