# Background Music Playlist

Place your background music files in this directory. The music player will automatically detect and play all audio files in alphabetical order.

## Supported Formats

- MP3 (recommended)
- WAV
- OGG
- M4A
- AAC
- FLAC

## How It Works

The music player automatically:
- Discovers all audio files in this directory at runtime
- Plays them in alphabetical order
- Loops back to the first song when the playlist ends
- Continues playing through the entire playlist

## File Naming

You can name your music files anything you want. They will be played in alphabetical order.

## Recommendations

- Keep file size reasonable (< 5MB per file recommended)
- Consider ambient or atmospheric music that complements the ancient languages theme
- Volume is set to 30% by default but users can adjust via the music toggle
- Use consistent naming for predictable playback order (e.g., `01-intro.mp3`, `02-ambient.mp3`)

## Examples

```
public/music/01-dawn.mp3
public/music/02-ancient-whispers.mp3
public/music/03-meditation.mp3
```

or

```
public/music/ambient-one.mp3
