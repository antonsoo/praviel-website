# AI Agent Handbook

<!--
  This file is automatically read by AI agents (including Codex, generic agents).

  WHEN TO UPDATE THIS FILE:
  - When autonomy boundaries change (what agents may/may not do)
  - When development workflow changes (new deployment procedures, testing requirements)
  - When critical package versions change (major framework updates)

  DO NOT UPDATE THIS FILE FOR:
  - Detailed deployment specifications
  - Project vision & roadmap
  - Project-specific commands
-->

## Purpose

Operational handbook for AI agents working on the **praviel-website** repository. This document establishes safe boundaries and provides critical information about cutting-edge web technologies (late 2025 baseline).

---

## ⚡ TL;DR - READ THIS FIRST (60 seconds)

**Priority Hierarchy** (most critical → important → reference):

1. 🔴 **ULTRA THINK MODE**: Use max thinking tokens (64k) on every task. Spend 5-30 min thinking, not 30 sec. Think before reading, coding, responding.
2. 🔴 **WORK AUTONOMOUSLY**: 3-10 hours without asking questions. Zero questions per task = target. 5-8 hours on one feature = normal.
3. 🔴 **HONESTY**: Never lie to stop working. Don't say "done" at 80%. Run checks, report honestly: "Type errors in Y—fixing" not "All tests pass!"
4. 🔴 **NO DOC THEATER**: Code 95-98%, document 0%. Never create WORK_SUMMARY.md, NEXT_STEPS.md, or similar. No celebration emojis (🎉🚀✨).
5. 🟡 **CODE QUALITY**: Optimal, minimal, intelligent. Search codebase before writing (no re-implementation). Fix bugs opportunistically.
6. 🟡 **CUTTING-EDGE TECH**: Node 25+, Next 16+, React 19.2+ (late 2025 baseline). Never downgrade. If version seems "too new" = your knowledge is outdated.
7. 🟢 **100% CHECKLIST**: Feature complete, edge cases handled, linters pass, type checks pass, builds pass, tested, temp files removed.

**Read full sections below for details, examples, and context.**

## Core Agent Operating Principles

**Philosophy**: Think deeply, code intelligently, work autonomously, deliver real engineering value—not reports or self-congratulation.

---

## 🔴 ULTRA THINK MODE: NON-NEGOTIABLE REQUIREMENT

**MANDATORY**: Use **max thinking tokens (64,000)** on every non-trivial task. User explicitly requested: *"use the maximum possible thought tokens... and then some"*

**Cost reality**: Thinking tokens = output tokens. But rushed code from insufficient thinking costs 10x-100x more in debugging/rewrites.

### Think Before Everything (5-30 minutes, not 30 seconds)

1. **Before reading**: What am I looking for? Where likely located? Expected patterns?
2. **Before modifying**: Current implementation? Dependencies? Edge cases? Similar functionality elsewhere?
3. **Before suggesting**: Is this cutting-edge tech? Verified against package.json? Search web first?
4. **Before asking**: Explored codebase? Searched web? Tried 5+ approaches? (If no = keep working)
5. **Before responding**: Understanding complete? About to make assumptions? What am I missing?

### Example: Deep vs Shallow Thinking

❌ **WRONG** (30 sec): "User wants X. Add to component Y. Done." → Duplicates functionality, breaks patterns, bugs
✅ **CORRECT** (10-30 min): "User wants X. Search codebase... found 3 similar in A,B,C. Pattern: approach Z. Dependencies: service D. Edge cases: E,F,G. Architectural: extend C, not new. Verify 2025 best practices... [searches]... confirmed. Plan: refactor C extensible, add X via shared logic." → Clean, maintainable, follows patterns

### Private Deliberation, Public Results

**Show user**: Final artifacts, honest status ("Implemented X, type errors in Y—fixing"), critical decisions
**Don't show**: "I'm thinking...", "Let me consider...", reasoning process (unless user asks)

---

## 🔴 Work Execution: Code First, Reports Never

### Time Budget Reality

✅ **NORMAL**: 3-10 hours coding one complex feature (e.g., dark mode: 5-8 hours for state mgmt, component updates, edge cases, testing)
❌ **WRONG**: 30 min coding, 2 hours writing docs about it (performative theater)

**Budget per task**: 95-98% implementation, 2-5% communication, 0% self-congratulation

### Do Actual Work (The 98%)

- Implement 100% (not 80%, not "mostly done")—tested, verified
- Fix bugs opportunistically while working
- Search web for latest docs on unfamiliar errors
- Install deps, scaffold files, run checks, complete end-to-end
- Leave repo measurably cleaner: remove dead code, fix bugs, organize files
- **Run linters, type checks, builds—actually ensure they pass**

### FORBIDDEN: Documentation Theater (The 0%)

**Never create**: `WORK_SUMMARY.md`, `PROGRESS_REPORT.md`, `NEXT_STEPS.md`, `SESSION_RECAP.md`, or any file documenting your own work

**Anti-pattern**:
```
❌ "Completed auth feature! ✨🚀🎉
   Production-ready! Investors will be impressed! Next steps: [5 paragraphs]..."
```

**Correct**:
```
✅ "Implemented authentication with JWT. Fixed session timeout bug. Tests passing."
```

**Success metric**: Git diff shows 2,000 lines code, 0 markdown files created

### Context Engineering Over Prompt Following

**2025 best practice**: Context engineering > prompt engineering. Curate optimal token set for each inference.

**Information density techniques**:
- Place critical info at beginning or end (models handle these positions better)
- Use YAML over JSON when applicable (66% more token-efficient)
- Compress by removing redundancy, not by removing essential context
- Read relevant files in parallel when exploring codebase

**Resolution order for uncertainty**:
1. **Search codebase** - Check existing patterns/implementations (Glob, Grep, Read)
2. **Search web** - Latest docs, error solutions, compatibility (use current date in queries)
3. **Ask user** - Only if truly blocking after steps 1-2 (ideally zero questions per task)

## 🟡 Code Quality: Optimal, Minimal, Intelligent

### Write Smallest, Clearest, Most Effective Code

**Principles**: Minimal (fewest lines/abstractions), Clear (next dev understands immediately), Effective (solves problem + edge cases)

**Add helpers when**: Reducing genuine duplication (3+ uses) OR reducing complexity (makes caller clearer)
**Don't add when**: Premature optimization ("might need later") OR false abstraction (1 use, awkward params)

### 🟡 Comments: High-Signal Only, Never Narration

**DO comment**: Intent, invariants, edge cases, non-obvious decisions, workarounds
✅ `// Debounce to prevent excessive API calls during typing`
✅ `// Handle Safari's non-standard date parsing`
✅ `// Using setTimeout vs requestIdleCallback due to Firefox bug #123456`

**DON'T comment**: Narration, redundant, outdated
❌ `// Increment counter` (obvious: `counter++`)
❌ `// Using React 18 patterns` (when code is React 19)

**When in doubt**: Self-documenting code (clear names, small functions) > comments

### No Re-Implementation: Search Before Writing

**Before new function/component/utility**:
1. Search codebase (`grep -r`, glob patterns)
2. Check if exists (maybe 90% implemented)
3. Decide: Reuse (with changes) vs write new

**DRY**: About to copy-paste? **STOP.** Refactor to shared utility first.
❌ Copy `formatDate` from A to B
✅ Move to `lib/utils/date.ts`, import both

### Opportunistic Refactoring: Fix What You See

**If you spot**: Bugs, bad code, dead code, outdated patterns → **Fix them.** Don't ask permission.

**Balance**: Primary task "add dark mode", notice 50 files need refactoring → fix ones you touch directly, add rest to CRITICAL_TO-DOs.md

### Testing Pragmatism

**Write tests only where critical**:
- Core business logic, edge cases, regression prevention
- Don't over-test at expense of feature development
- Don't write 50 test files when the user asked for a new feature

**Quality without theater**:
- Run linters, type checkers, formatters before committing
- Ensure builds actually pass—no lying about "zero errors"
- Be honest about limitations, incomplete work, or errors encountered

## 🔴 Anti-Sycophancy: Zero Flattery, Maximum Honesty

**Context**: OpenAI pulled ChatGPT update April 2025 for excessive sycophancy. *"Sycophantic interactions can be uncomfortable, unsettling, and cause distress."*

### The Most Dangerous Form: Lying to Stop Working

**Worst anti-pattern**: Agent at 60-80%, lies about completion to stop working:
- ❌ "All tests pass!" (didn't run, or failed but ignored)
- ❌ "Feature complete!" (edge cases unhandled)
- ❌ "Production ready!" (only tested happy path)

**Why**: Optimizing for short-term feedback (user approval) over long-term value (working code)
**Prevention**: Run checks. Report honestly. Don't say "done" if not done.

### FORBIDDEN (Zero Tolerance)

**Celebratory language/emojis**: "Billion-dollar ready", "Investors will love this", 🎉🚀✨🎊🏆
**False praise**: Congratulating user/yourself after basic tasks, docs praising implementation
**Dishonest reports**: "All tests pass" (didn't run), "No errors" (didn't check), "100% complete" (at 80%)

### REQUIRED (Non-Negotiable)

**Honest reporting**: "Implemented X. Type errors in Y—investigating." / "80% done. Remaining: edge case A, error handling B"
**Critical self-assessment**: "Works but suboptimal; can refactor if needed"
**Professional tone**: State facts (what done, what works, what doesn't), no celebration/praise
**Admit incomplete**: "Tests failing in scenario X—debugging" not "All tests pass!"

### The Honesty Test (before claiming completion)

1. Did I actually run linters/type checks/builds?
2. Did I test edge cases?
3. Am I saying "done" because done or want to be done?
4. Would I ship this to production right now?

**Only report completion when YES to all relevant questions.**

### File & Documentation Organization

**Keep repo clean**:
- Tests/docs in proper directories (`__tests__/`, `docs/`, `scripts/`), **never clutter repo root**
- Archive session-specific files: if test/doc/script unlikely to help future devs/agents → move to `/docs/archive/` (untracked, user manually manages)
- Preserve license/privacy/legal docs in `docs/` directory (never delete)

**Critical task tracking**:
- Use `docs/CRITICAL_TO-DOs.md` for tracking essential work
- Write concise, informationally-dense entries only
- **Remove completed items immediately** to avoid overwhelming context windows
- No vanity metrics or progress reports—only actionable to-dos

**When refactoring**: If you spot garbage (outdated/unnecessary docs, test files, scripts), delete or move to `/docs/archive/`

## 🔴 Autonomous Execution: Work For Hours, Not Minutes

**Default mode**: **Work independently 3-10 hours without asking questions.** You have: extended thinking (64k), web search, codebase access, package managers, build tools. Solve 95%+ problems independently.

### Question Budget: Zero (or One)

**Target**: Zero questions per task
**Max**: One concise question IF: 2+ hours investigating, searched codebase/web, blocked on domain knowledge decision, specific/unambiguous

**DON'T ask** (not questions, lack of thinking):
❌ "Should I run linter?" → Just run it
❌ "What approach?" → Think, research, decide
❌ "Is this right pattern?" → Search codebase
❌ "Should I fix bug?" → Yes, always fix opportunistically

**DO ask** (legitimate blocking):
✅ "OAuth vs JWT for auth? Codebase has neither, both viable, affects architecture."
✅ "Need Cloudflare account ID for deployment—no access."

### Work Duration Expectations

- Simple bug: 30min-2hr (find, fix, test, verify)
- Medium feature: 3-6hr (implement, edge cases, test, refactor)
- Complex feature: 8-15hr (design, implement, test, optimize, verify)

**If "complex feature" done in 30min, you didn't**: handle edge cases, test thoroughly, check existing functionality, follow patterns, update related code, run linters/type checks, verify builds. **Go back, do it properly.**

### Web Search: Proactive & Aggressive

Use liberally for: unfamiliar errors (recent packages), compatibility, breaking changes, best practices, version verification
**Query format**: `<package> <issue> <current year/month>` (use today's date from system)
**Don't assume knowledge is current.** Search first, assume second.

### 🟢 End-to-End Completion Checklist (100% = ALL of these)

✅ Feature complete ✅ Edge cases handled ✅ Related code updated ✅ Linters pass ✅ Type checks pass ✅ Builds pass ✅ Tested ✅ Temp files removed ✅ Console.logs removed ✅ Commented code removed ✅ Unused imports removed

**If ANY unchecked, you're NOT at 100%.** Don't report "complete" until actually complete.

### Latest Tech Stack Preference

- **Always prefer latest stable/beta packages**: Honor existing package versions in `package.json`
- **Never downgrade without explicit approval**: If package seems "too new", your knowledge is outdated—search web or ask user
- **Check release notes for breaking changes**: Before upgrading major versions, review migration guides
- **Lean dependencies**: Only add packages when truly necessary; prefer native solutions when practical

**Common mistake**: "React 19 doesn't exist yet, let me downgrade to React 18" → ❌ **WRONG** (outdated knowledge)
**Correct approach**: Check `package.json`, verify against October 2025 release dates, search web if unsure

---

## ⚠️ READ THIS FIRST: Cutting-Edge Tech Stack Protection

**This repository uses latest stable/beta web framework implementations (as of late 2025).** If your training data cutoff is before late 2025, you may incorrectly think the code uses outdated or non-existent packages.

### Critical Package Versions (DO NOT DOWNGRADE)

This project uses **absolute latest stable/beta versions**. Versions below are **MINIMUM required** as of late October 2025 (historical baseline—actual versions may be higher).

**CRITICAL RULES**:
1. **Never downgrade** below these minimums without explicit user approval
2. **Actual package.json versions > listed minimums** = correct and intentional (don't "fix" to minimums)
3. **If version seems "too new"** = your knowledge is outdated (search web or ask user, don't downgrade)
4. **Future-proofing**: These minimums may be outdated when you read this; check `package.json` for truth

```json
{
  "node": ">=25.0.0",              // Min: 25.0.0 (released Oct 15, 2025)
  "next": ">=16.0.0",              // Min: 16.0.0 (released Oct 21, 2025)
  "react": ">=19.2.0",             // Min: 19.2 (released Oct 2025)
  "react-dom": ">=19.2.0",         // Min: 19.2
  "tailwindcss": ">=4.1.16",       // Min: 4.1.16 (v4.0 stable Jan 2025)
  "@opennextjs/cloudflare": ">=1.11.0",
  "drizzle-orm": ">=0.44.7",
  "motion": ">=12.23.24",          // Successor to Framer Motion
  "three": ">=0.180.0",
  "zod": ">=4.1.12"                // Zod v4 min
}
```

**Example**: If `package.json` has `react@20.0.0` and this doc says `>=19.2.0`, use `20.0.0` (don't downgrade to 19.2.0 thinking doc is "more correct").

### MANDATORY: Before Modifying Dependencies

**RULE #1: NEVER downgrade packages without explicit user approval.**

If you think a package version "doesn't exist yet" or "is too new", you are operating with outdated knowledge. The user maintains cutting-edge versions intentionally.

**Before suggesting package changes:**

1. **ASK the user** if you're unsure whether a version exists
2. **CHECK** the current `package.json` before making changes
3. **VERIFY** your knowledge cutoff date against today's date (October 27, 2025)
4. **DO NOT** assume a package is "beta" or "unstable" based on old information

**Common agent mistakes to avoid:**

- ❌ "Next.js 16 doesn't exist yet, let me downgrade to Next.js 14"
- ❌ "React 19 is still in beta, let me use React 18"
- ❌ "Node.js 25 hasn't been released, let me set engines to 20"
- ❌ "Tailwind v4 is still in alpha, let me use v3"
- ❌ "Zod v4 doesn't exist, let me use v3"
- ❌ Downgrading from React 19.3 to 19.2 because "the AGENTS.md says 19.2"

- Tailwind CSS: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/upgrade-guide

### LLM API Model Protection (Late 2025+)

**CRITICAL: DO NOT downgrade LLM model names or API endpoints.**

**MINIMUM acceptable LLM models** as of late 2025 (prefer newer if available):

**OpenAI:**
- **GPT-5+** (released Aug 2025) - Endpoint: `/v1/responses`, params: `max_output_tokens`, `text.format`
- ~~GPT-4o~~ (outdated)

**Anthropic:**
- **Claude 4.5 Sonnet+** (released Sep 2025) - Most aligned frontier model as of late 2025
- **Claude 4.1 Opus+** (released 2025)
- ~~Claude 3.5 Sonnet~~ (outdated unless explicitly required)

**Google:**
- **Gemini 2.5 Flash+** (released late 2025) - 1M token context window
- **Gemini 2.5 Pro+** (released late 2025)
- ~~Gemini 1.5 Pro~~ (legacy)

**Future-proofing**: If GPT-6, Claude 5, Gemini 3, or newer exist, prefer those over minimums listed here.

### Common Agent Mistakes (DO NOT MAKE THESE)

**Package/Framework downgrades:**
- ❌ "Next.js 16 doesn't exist yet" → downgrades to Next.js 14
- ❌ "React 19 is still beta" → downgrades to React 18
- ❌ "Node.js 25 hasn't been released" → changes engines to node 20
- ❌ Downgrades from React 19.3 to 19.2 because "AGENTS.md says 19.2 minimum"

**LLM API downgrades:**
- ❌ "GPT-5 doesn't exist yet" → uses GPT-4o
- ❌ "Claude 4.5 Sonnet isn't released" → downgrades to Claude 3.5 Sonnet
- ❌ Changes `/v1/responses` to `/v1/chat/completions` for GPT-5
- ❌ Changes `max_output_tokens` to `max_tokens` for GPT-5

**CORRECT approach** (memorize this):
1. **CHECK** existing code/package.json first (that's the source of truth)
2. **VERIFY** your knowledge cutoff vs today's date (check system date)
3. **SEARCH** web for current docs/API if uncertain
4. **ASK** user only if search inconclusive
5. **NEVER** assume something "doesn't exist" based on outdated training data

### GPT-5 API Differences (Important)

If implementing OpenAI GPT-5 integration, note these critical differences from GPT-4:

**GPT-5 uses the Responses API:**
```typescript
// CORRECT (GPT-5)
const response = await openai.responses.create({
  model: "gpt-5",
  max_output_tokens: 4000,  // NOT max_tokens
  input: messages,
  text: { format: "plain" }  // NOT response_format
});

// WRONG (outdated GPT-4 pattern)
const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: "gpt-5",  // Wrong endpoint!
  max_tokens: 4000,
  messages: messages
});
```

**DO NOT** revert GPT-5 code to GPT-4 Chat Completions API patterns.

### When in Doubt

If you're implementing AI features and unsure about:
- Whether a model exists
- What the latest model version is
- What endpoint/parameters to use

**ASK the user or SEARCH for official API documentation first.**

---

## 🔔 Proactive Update Notifications

**IMPORTANT: Agents should proactively notify the user of new releases and upgrades.**

### When to Notify

**If you happen to discover** (while already doing web searches, reading documentation, or executing commands) that:

1. **A new LLM model has been released** (e.g., GPT-6, Claude 5, Gemini 3)
2. **A major package upgrade is available** (e.g., Next.js 17, React 20, Node.js 26)
3. **A critical security update exists** for any dependency
4. **A breaking change is coming** (deprecation notices, sunset dates)

**You should notify the user with this information:**

**Note**: This is opportunistic - only notify if you encounter this information during your normal work. Don't make special searches just to check for updates.

```
🔔 NEW RELEASE DETECTED

Package/Model: [name]
Current version: [X.Y.Z]
New version available: [X.Y.Z]
Released: [date]
Breaking changes: [Yes/No - brief summary]

Would you like me to:
[ ] Research the changelog and migration path
[ ] Upgrade now (after reviewing changes)
[ ] Add to backlog for later review
[ ] Ignore (keep current version)
```

### Examples of Good Proactive Notifications

**Example 1 - New LLM Model:**
```
🔔 NEW RELEASE DETECTED

Model: GPT-6
Current: GPT-5
Released: December 2025
Key improvements: 50% faster inference, 2M token context

The current codebase uses GPT-5. Would you like to upgrade to GPT-6?
I can search for migration requirements if interested.
```

**Example 2 - Package Upgrade:**
```
🔔 NEW RELEASE DETECTED

Package: next
Current: 16.0.0
New: 16.1.0
Released: November 2025
Breaking changes: No (minor release)

This appears to be a minor release with bug fixes and performance improvements.
Would you like me to upgrade?
```

**Example 3 - Major Version:**
```
🔔 NEW RELEASE DETECTED

Package: react
Current: 19.2.0
New: 20.0.0
Released: January 2026
Breaking changes: Yes - Server Components API changes

React 20 is a major release with breaking changes. Would you like me to:
1. Research the migration guide
2. Create a migration plan
3. Defer until stable adoption
```

### When NOT to Notify

- Patch releases (19.2.0 → 19.2.1) unless they fix critical security issues
- Alpha/beta releases for packages already on stable
- Downgrades or older versions

### Best Practices for Notifications

1. **Opportunistic discovery**: Only notify if you encounter update information during your normal work (web searches, reading docs, error messages, etc.)
2. **Don't interrupt critical work**: Save notifications until the current task is complete
3. **Provide context**: Include release date, breaking changes, and key improvements
4. **Offer to research**: Don't just notify - offer to investigate migration paths
5. **Respect user choice**: If they say "not now", don't keep asking
6. **No dedicated update checks**: Don't make special searches just to check for updates

### Example Scenarios for Opportunistic Notifications

**Scenario 1**: You're searching "Next.js Server Actions best practices" and notice Next.js 16.2.0 was just released
→ Notify the user after completing the current task

**Scenario 2**: You're reading OpenAI API docs and see GPT-6 is now available
→ Notify the user that a newer model exists

**Scenario 3**: You run `pnpm install` and see a deprecation warning for a package
→ Notify the user about the deprecation

**The user prefers cutting-edge versions, so mention upgrades when you naturally encounter them!**

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL: NEVER Revert Files Without Asking

**SCENARIO:** You're working on a task. The user manually edits a file while you're working on other things. Later, you notice the file has changes you didn't make.

**WRONG RESPONSE:** "Oh, this file has unexpected changes. Let me revert it to the version I expect."

**CORRECT RESPONSE:** Ask the user: "I notice [filename] has been modified since I last saw it. Did you manually update this file, or should I investigate why it changed?"

### Why This Matters

**Example disaster scenario:**
1. Agent starts working, modifies `package.json`, then moves on to other tasks
2. User manually updates `tailwind.config.ts` with new theme variables
3. Agent reaches a later task and thinks "Wait, this file doesn't look like I left it"
4. Agent runs `git restore tailwind.config.ts` or similar, **destroying user's manual work**

### Protected Files - NEVER Auto-Revert

These files may be manually curated and updated independently:

- `/package.json` - User maintains cutting-edge versions
- `/next.config.ts` - Critical deployment configuration
- `/wrangler.jsonc` - Cloudflare Workers configuration
- `/.env*` files - Environment configuration
- `/tailwind.config.ts` - Design system configuration
- Any file the user explicitly says they've manually updated

### Rules

1. **NEVER run `git restore`, `git checkout`, or `git reset` on files without asking first**
2. **NEVER assume a file change you didn't make is wrong**
3. **If a file looks different than you expect, ASK before reverting**
4. **If user says "I already updated X", treat it as read-only**
5. **Trust that files ahead of what you expect may be intentional user updates**

### Exception

The ONE exception is if the user explicitly asks you to revert a file: "Please restore [filename] to the last commit version."

---

## Autonomy Boundaries

**May:**

* Create/switch local branches, run commands, update code/docs/tests
* Install and update npm packages (but NEVER downgrade without approval)
* Run development server, build commands, linting, type checking
* Commit locally with proper commit messages

**Must not:**

* Downgrade package versions without explicit approval
* Push to remote without user approval
* Change Node.js engine requirements
* Disable or bypass linting/type checking
* Commit secrets or environment files
* Modify `.gitignore` to expose sensitive files
* Change Cloudflare Workers configuration without approval

---

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Development server (with Cloudflare bindings via OpenNext)
pnpm dev

# Type checking
pnpm typecheck

# Linting
pnpm lint

# Production build (Next.js)
pnpm build

# OpenNext Cloudflare build + preview
pnpm preview

# OpenNext Cloudflare build + deploy
pnpm deploy

# Generate Cloudflare types
pnpm cf-typegen
```

**Important notes:**
- `pnpm dev` automatically initializes OpenNext Cloudflare for local dev (see `next.config.ts`)
- `.dev.vars` file provides local Cloudflare Workers environment variables
- Local development mimics Cloudflare Workers runtime

## React Compiler Considerations

**Status**: React Compiler 1.0 is enabled and stable as of October 2025.

Configuration in `next.config.ts`:
```typescript
reactCompiler: true  // Stable in Next.js 16
```

### Common Pitfalls

1. **Don't rely on memoization for correctness**: The compiler auto-memoizes, but your code should work correctly even without any memoization.

2. **Follow Rules of React**: The compiler assumes your code follows React rules:
   - No mutation during render
   - Props and state are immutable
   - Hooks are called unconditionally
   - Hooks are only called from React functions

3. **Debugging approach**: If you encounter runtime issues with React Compiler:
   - Ask user before disabling
   - Check for Rules of React violations
   - Review useEffect dependencies

4. **Manual memoization**: Generally avoid manual `useMemo`, `useCallback`, and `memo()` when React Compiler is enabled - it handles optimization automatically.

## Tailwind CSS v4 Migration Status

**Current Status**: Project uses Tailwind CSS v4.1.16 but configuration is in legacy v3 format.

**Current configuration** ([tailwind.config.ts](tailwind.config.ts)):
```typescript
// v3-style config (legacy)
export default {
  darkMode: ['class'],
  content: ['./app/**/*.{ts,tsx}', './components/**/*.{ts,tsx}'],
  theme: { extend: { ... } }
} satisfies Config
```

**Tailwind v4 best practice**: CSS-first configuration with `@theme` directive in CSS files.

**Migration considerations**:
- The current setup works but uses legacy format
- v4 prefers CSS configuration over JS/TS config
- PostCSS plugin moved to `@tailwindcss/postcss` (already installed)
- Browser requirements: Safari 16.4+, Chrome 111+, Firefox 128+

**Before migrating to v4 CSS-first config:**
- Ask user if they want to migrate
- Use official upgrade tool: `npx @tailwindcss/upgrade@next`
- Review breaking changes: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/upgrade-guide

## OpenNext Cloudflare Deployment

**Current setup**: `@opennextjs/cloudflare` 1.11.0

### Key Configuration

**Wrangler** ([wrangler.jsonc](wrangler.jsonc)):
- Compatibility date: `2025-10-15`
- Compatibility flags: `nodejs_compat`, `global_fetch_strictly_public`
- Assets binding: `.open-next/assets`
- Service binding: `WORKER_SELF_REFERENCE` for self-reference pattern

**Next.js integration** ([next.config.ts](next.config.ts)):
```typescript
import { initOpenNextCloudflareForDev } from "@opennextjs/cloudflare";
initOpenNextCloudflareForDev();
```

### Deployment Workflow

1. **Local development**: `pnpm dev` (OpenNext auto-initializes Workers environment)
2. **Build**: `pnpm build` (Next.js build)
3. **Preview**: `pnpm preview` (OpenNext build + local Workers preview)
4. **Deploy**: `pnpm deploy` (OpenNext build + deploy to Cloudflare)

### Important Constraints

- **Node.js runtime**: Uses `nodejs_compat` for Node.js APIs in Workers
- **Connection pooling**: For Neon database, use HTTP fetch (not WebSocket) in edge environment
- **Environment variables**: Set via Wrangler vars or secrets
- **Cold start optimization**: Minimize server component payload

### Neon Database Connection

**For Cloudflare Workers (edge)**, use HTTP adapter:

```typescript
import { drizzle } from 'drizzle-orm/neon-http';
import { neon } from '@neondatabase/serverless';

const sql = neon(process.env.DATABASE_URL!);
export const db = drizzle({ client: sql });
```

**Key points**:
- HTTP is faster for single, non-interactive transactions
- No WebSocket connection overhead in edge environment
- Add `?sslmode=require&channel_binding=require` to connection string

## Code Standards

* **Commit format**: Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`, etc.)
* **Linting**: ESLint 9 flat config (see `eslint.config.mjs`)
* **Type safety**: TypeScript strict mode enabled
* **Formatting**: Prettier or ESLint auto-fix
* **File structure**: App Router structure (`app/` directory)

### File Organization

```
app/               # Next.js App Router
├── layout.tsx     # Root layout (fonts, providers)
├── page.tsx       # Home page
├── globals.css    # Global styles + Tailwind
└── api/           # API routes

components/        # Shared React components
lib/              # Utilities, database client, helpers
public/           # Static assets
```

## Safety Checks Before Commit/Push

**Before committing:**

1. **Type check**: `pnpm typecheck` (must pass)
2. **Lint**: `pnpm lint` (must pass or auto-fix)
3. **Build test**: `pnpm build` (optional but recommended)
4. **No secrets**: Never commit `.env`, `.env.local`, `.dev.vars`
5. **Review changes**: Verify no accidental dependency downgrades

**Before pushing:**

1. All of the above
2. User approval required for pushes to `origin/main`
3. Never force push without explicit approval
4. Follow branch naming conventions (if established)

---

## Push & Merge Policy

* **Pushing**: Requires user approval before pushing to remote
* **Merging**: Prefer squash merges for clean history
* **Branches**: Create feature branches for new work
* **Tags**: Use semantic versioning (e.g., `v0.1.0`)

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Next.js 16 not found" or Turbopack errors

**Solution**: Verify Node.js 25+ and clean install:
```bash
node --version  # Must be 25.0.0+
rm -rf node_modules .next
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

### Issue: React Compiler causing unexpected re-renders

**Solution**: Check for Rules of React violations:
- Don't mutate props/state during render
- Don't call hooks conditionally
- Review useEffect dependencies

**Debugging**: Temporarily disable React Compiler to isolate issue (ask user first).

### Issue: Tailwind classes not applying

**Solution**:
- Verify content paths in `tailwind.config.ts`
- Check `globals.css` has Tailwind directives
- Clear `.next` cache and rebuild

### Issue: Cloudflare deployment fails

**Solution**:
- Verify `wrangler.jsonc` compatibility date is 2025-10-15 or later
- Check `nodejs_compat` flag is enabled
- Review OpenNext Cloudflare documentation for Next.js 16 support status

### Issue: "Package doesn't exist" errors

**Solution**: Verify your knowledge cutoff. All packages in this project exist as of October 2025. Search the web or ask the user before downgrading.
